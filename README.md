# An Optimized Sudoku Solver
![CMake](https://github.com/AdityaGupta150/sudokuSolver_Optimized/workflows/CMake/badge.svg)
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/AdityaGupta150/sudokuSolver_Optimized.svg?branch=master)

An optimised backtracking sudoku solver, that only iterates for the narrowed down possibilities, includes usual unoptimized backtracking too

Implements multi-threading, using upto 9 threads during optimisation, for each row.

## Building

----

### Windows

Two Ways ->

1. If you have MSVC compiler, open vs code from Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt, and click `Ctrl + Shift + B` to run the default build task

2. Using CMAKE,

    ``` sh
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ```

    \* Or open the .sln solution file using visual studio then get executable

    <br>

    Using either way, you will get a sudokuSolver.exe, on a succesful build, that's it ! üòÑ

### Linux

* Using CMAKE and makefiles-

    ```sh
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make .
    ```

    This will provide you with an executable named `sudokuSolver`, on a successful build üëç

_Fun Fact - This time i have more build methods for Windows, not Linux... quite rare_ üòÖ

### Working -

* The `sudoku` class (sudoku.hpp) is the primary class, and uses `box<>` (box.hpp) as elements of 9x9 grid (for now, they just store a single value)

* The `sudoku::board` is the grid storing the actual values... and `EMPTY` is an enum var equating to `0`. `sudoku::_possibilities` is also a 2D array, storing `std::set` of possible values at that index

* `sudoku::optimise` iterates through each row, assigns possibile values to each cell... then iterate through each column, and then each 3x3 block, thereby reducing the possibilities, and hence the recursion depth

* `sudoku::solve` applies simple backtrakking to solve the board,
if `sudoku::optimise` has been called earlier, then the optimised vairant of `sudoku::backtrackSolve_opt` will be used, else `sudoku::backtrackSolve`

If you want more detail about something else, or more briefing on the above ones, do raise an issue :D

### Further Improvements -

* `sudoku::optimise()` can be populated with more sudoku tricks, like naked triplets/pairs and others.
